Ari's Branch

Second paragraph

I'm working for an hourly wage
I went to high school, didn't do great
Still I gotta make more cash
More education is what I'm looking at
When I get a degree
I will make a bigger salary
So now I've got to see
Which college is right for me

[Verse 2]
I went on the Internet
And found education conn-ec-tion
I took some free tests
To find out my direction
